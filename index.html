  <p>Looking at South Asian GDP and population growth over the past few years, we see
  a large disparity. When analyzing the population differences and the GDP gap between countries
  there is a correlation between the size of the economy (measured in GDP) and the growing population.
  From this we can predict the growth of the economies in each country and see the link between
  population spikes and thriving domestic economies. To find out more about Asia's progression visit

   <p>South Asian countries are not amoungst the most developed in Asia. This can be attributed todo
   the increased political uncertainties that seem to be concentrated in this region. They also lack input
  infrastructure, where if it were imporved, productivity growth would spike. By measuring the population growth
  and GDP we can predict future developments in the economy and population. To find out more about Asia's progression visit
